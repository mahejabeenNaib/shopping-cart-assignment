# XT Shopping Cart Assignment

This is the base folder for the shopping cart exercise. You will have all the static assets and mock server responses available in this repo.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and run following command for starting the application and mock server:

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure node is installed in your system.

2. Go to the checked out project folder and run the command `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run serve`

Runs the backend server at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for development (takes .env.development) to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
